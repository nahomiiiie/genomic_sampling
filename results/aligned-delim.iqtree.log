Host:    Loaner-Mac-RJJ1WL (AVX2, FMA3, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05 -nt 1 -s results/aligned-delim.fasta -m GTR
Seed:    147692 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Aug 19 16:45:01 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file results/aligned-delim.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 102 sequences with 29903 columns, 69 distinct patterns
26 parsimony-informative, 45 singleton sites, 29832 constant sites
