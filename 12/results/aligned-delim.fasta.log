IQ-TREE multicore version 2.1.4-beta COVID-edition for Mac OS X 64-bit built Jun 24 2021
Developed by Bui Quang Minh, James Barbetti, Nguyen Lam Tung,
Olga Chernomor, Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    Stevia.local (AVX2, FMA3, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05 -nt 1 -s results/aligned-delim.fasta -m GTR
Seed:    605738 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Oct 19 23:00:04 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file results/aligned-delim.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 63 sequences with 29903 columns, 62 distinct patterns
30 parsimony-informative, 36 singleton sites, 29837 constant sites
